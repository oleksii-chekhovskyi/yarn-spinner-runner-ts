## Markup (Yarn Spinner)

Source: [docs.yarnspinner.dev — Markup](https://docs.yarnspinner.dev/write-yarn-scripts/advanced-scripting/markup)

### What it covers
- Rich text features embedded in lines (emphasis, links, inline commands).
- Parsed and passed to the host for rendering.

### Example
```yarn
title: Start
---
Narrator: This is *italic*, this is **bold**, and this is a [link](game:codex/entry1).
===
```

Supported markup and rendering vary by integration.
