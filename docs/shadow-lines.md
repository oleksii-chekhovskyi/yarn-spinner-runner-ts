## Shadow Lines (Yarn Spinner)

Source: [docs.yarnspinner.dev — Shadow Lines](https://docs.yarnspinner.dev/write-yarn-scripts/advanced-scripting/shadow-lines)

### What it covers
- Author alternative versions of lines (e.g., localized/variant lines) without changing IDs.
- Useful for VO/loc updates while preserving references.

### Example (conceptual)
```yarn
title: Start
---
Narrator: Primary line content.
// Shadow line variants are managed by tooling to swap text without new IDs.
===
```
