## Functions (Yarn Spinner)

Source: [docs.yarnspinner.dev — Functions](https://docs.yarnspinner.dev/write-yarn-scripts/scripting-fundamentals/functions)

### What it covers
- Use functions in expressions for calculations and queries.
- Custom functions can be exposed by the host game.

### Examples
```yarn
title: Start
---
<<set total = add(2, 3)>>
Narrator: The total is {total}.

```

Function names/arity/behavior depend on your integration’s function bindings.
