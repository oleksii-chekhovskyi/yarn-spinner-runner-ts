## Line Groups (Yarn Spinner)

Source: [docs.yarnspinner.dev — Line Groups](https://docs.yarnspinner.dev/write-yarn-scripts/scripting-fundamentals/line-groups)

### What it covers
- Group related lines for localization, organization, or metadata.
- Often used to assign tags or manage VO/loc pipelines.

### Example (conceptual)
```yarn
title: Start
---
// Lines here can be assigned to a group via editor metadata.
Narrator: Grouped line A.
Narrator: Grouped line B.

```

Details vary by tooling (e.g., Yarn Spinner Editor/VS Code integration).
